**hyperglass** is a modern network looking glass application. A looking glass is typically implemented by network service providers as a way of providing customers, peers, and partners with a way to easily view elements of, or run tests from the provider's network.

**hyperglass is developed with the express intention of being free to the networking community**.

*However, the hyperglass demo does cost [/checktheroads](https://github.com/checktheroads) about $15/month for 3 Digital Ocean droplets. If you're feeling particularly helpful and want to help offset that cost, small donations are welcome.*

## Acknowledgements

-   This project originally started as a fork of [vraulsan](https://github.com/vraulsan)'s [looking-glass](https://github.com/vraulsan/looking-glass) project. The guts of the Flask components still remain from that project, but almost everything else has been rewritten. Nevertheless, the inspiration for building hyperglass came from here.
